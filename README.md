# canonical-coloring

Implementation of Berkholz, Bonsma, and Grohe's O((m+n)log n) algorithm for computing a canonical
coloring (or coarsest equitable partition) for digraphs. Our implementation is a bit less efficient
as it uses a vector of sets to represent the current partition.

Rather than using a stack for ```s_refine```, a queue is used in which new colors are pushed at the back,
and colors are poped from the front. This seems to yield *1-WL canonical colorings:* a coloring
is 1-WL canonical if two graphs that are 1-WL equivalent (with respect to multiset-based colors)
obtain the same coloring (up to 1-WL isomorphisms). This property, however, needs formal proof,
or a counter example (if you find one, please let us know).

Provided functionality computes the (canonical) quotient matrix Q for the given graph. The entry
Q[i,j] counts the number of edges from a node with color i to nodes of color j, for the
(final) equitable partition.

Source code includes a simpe class for digraphs, and two exacutables: ```simple_test```, and
```graphs_DIMACS```.  The first computes the canonical partition and quotient matrix for a number
of simple graphs with given initial colorings. 
The second computes canonical partitions for the graphs listed in a file that is given as argument.
Each line in the file must be the filename for a graph in DIMACS format. 
A repository of such files can be found [here.](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Graphs.html)
See the source code of the examples to see how to use the coloring algorithm.

The following results were obtained with ```graphs_DIMACS``` on the collection ```dac```
for graphs associated with CNF formulas. In the results, ```n``` and ```m``` are
the number of vertices and edges, respectively, and ```k``` is the number of
colors in the canonical coloring:
